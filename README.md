# AWS Infrastructure Setup

## Overview
This project sets up a scalable and secure AWS infrastructure, including a VPC, public and private subnets, EC2 instances, a Bastion server, NAT Gateway, database server, and other essential AWS services.

## Architecture
- **VPC** with public and private subnets
- **EC2 Instances** in public and private subnets
- **Bastion Server & NAT Gateway** for secure access
- **Database Server** in a private subnet
- **S3 Bucket & EFS** for storage
- **Load Balancer & Auto Scaling** for high availability
- **Security Groups, NACLs, and IAM Roles** for security
- **CloudWatch & CloudTrail** for monitoring
- **SNS** for notifications

## Deployment Steps
1. Create VPC and subnets.
2. Attach an Internet Gateway and configure routing.
3. Set up NAT Gateway for private subnet access.
4. Configure security groups and IAM roles.
5. Launch EC2 instances and database server.
6. Set up Load Balancer and Auto Scaling.
7. Enable CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and SNS.

## Benefits
- **Scalability & High Availability**
- **Enhanced Security** with controlled access
- **Cost Efficiency** through optimized resource usage
- **Real-time Monitoring & Alerts** via CloudWatch & SNS

## Testing & Validation
- Verify network configurations and EC2 access.
- Test Load Balancer and Auto Scaling.
- Validate S3 and EFS storage access.
- Monitor logs and alerts in CloudWatch.

## Conclusion
This AWS infrastructure ensures security, scalability, and efficiency, providing a reliable cloud environment for applications and databases.
